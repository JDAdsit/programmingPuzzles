In this puzzle there are two roads. One is the main street and the other is a sidestreet that turns off the main street. Trucks are lining up for a parade and need to be in a specific order. They can pull into the side street and pull back out into the main street, but once they have passed the sidestreet they can't back up. The puzzle is to write a program that can tell you if a given order of trucks can be re-organized so it is in the correct order.
